# Centrally-Managed conda Environments on the ESI HPC Cluster

The ESI Software Support Group provides a set of pre-configured `conda` environments for
use on the ESI high-performance computing cluster. Every environment is set up
and tested on the institute's cluster with the demands of multiple users in mind.

## Usage

All environments have been assembled and tested on cluster nodes equipped with Intel
Xeon processors running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 and SLURM 20.02.

### Installation

Setting up an environment requires a recent version of `conda` (4.4+) shipped with
Anaconda or Minoconda, both obtainable from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html).
Please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#installation)
to install `conda` on your system.
Once `conda` is up and running, you may use any of the provided YAML files
(see [Documentation](#Documentation) for details) to set up the corresponding
environment on your computer by performing the following steps:

1. **Windows**: Open the *Anaconda Prompt* from the *Start* menu\
   **macOS**/**Linux**: open a terminal and add the `conda` command to your shell, i.e.,\
   `source /path/to/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`  (for bash users)\
   `source /path/to/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.csh` (for csh/tcsh users)
2. Create environment from the corresponding YAML file\
   `conda env create --file envs/<ENVIRONMENT>.yml`
3. To enable interactive controls for matplotlib figures in Jupyter notebooks,
   the following additional steps are required:
   - Activate the just created environment\
     `conda activate ENVIRONMENT`
   - Install necessary JupyterLab extensions:\
     `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`\
     `jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib`
   - Use the command\
     `jupyter labextension list`\
     to ensure that both extensions are "enabled" and "OK"

### Testing

The directory `tests` of this repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter
notebooks to test-drive any created environment. Specifically, Jupyter and its
interactive widgets tend to warrant a quick trial run:

```bash
jupyter lab --ip `hostname` --no-browser --notebook-dir esi-conda/tests/
```

### Trouble-Shooting

All environments have been validated for consistency with respect to dependency
resolution. If `conda` nevertheless complains about conflicting dependencies when
trying to install one of our environments, please open an issue in our
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/esi-neuroscience/esi-conda/issues).

Other than package dependence consistency, interactive figure support in Jupyter
notebooks tends to require some additional tinkering with setting up JupyterLab
extensions and/or `npm` packages. Effective trouble-shooting strongly
depends on the specific hardware platform (CPU architecture, RAM availability) and
the software environment (operating system, `conda` version, `node.js` version etc.).
However, a boilerplate strategy to debug missing interactive figure widgets (*"model not found"* or *"widget loading..."* errors) is to clean up all relevant caches and
re-build the JavaScript components of JupyterLab:

```bash
jlpm cache clean
jupyter lab clean
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
jupyter lab build
```

Many extensions are still under heavy development and might introduce substantial
changes between releases. It is usually helpful to consult the GitHub issue trackers
of the respective extensions - oftentimes others already ran into similar problems
and have already found workarounds.

## Documentation

All YAML files with names containing the suffix "*_concretized*" have been generated by
exporting the corresponding environments on the ESI HPC cluster. Thus,
`<ENVIRONMENT>_concretized.yml` files can be used to re-create exact clones of ESI compute cluster
environments provided the host system is also a Linux machine. To set up
an environment on another platform, please use the corresponding `<ENVIRONMENT>.yml` file instead,
as outlined in [Installation](#Installation).

Please refer to [the official conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment) for more details about virtual environment management with `conda`.

### Layout

This repository is structured as follows:

- `envs`: contains YAML environment specification files
- `tests`: contains scripts and notebooks to test/try-out environments

### Available environments

- `esi-202xa`/`esi-202xb`: standard "reference" Python environment that is
  updated bi-annually. Comprises most widely used scientific computing packages
  (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, dask, scikit, mne etc.) in their respective
  most recent versions.
